About
======
I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Princeton University/NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL). Prior to this, I got my Ph.D. in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). 

I am broadly interested in atmospheric circulation dynamics, with research experiences covering sudden stratospheric warming (SSW), atmospheric blocking, surface air temperature variability, etc. These pursuits share a common theme: how do atmospheric dynamics contribute to weather and climate extremes? My current focus is on the role of the stratosphere in surface cold extremes.
