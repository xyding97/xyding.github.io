About
======
I am a fourth year Ph.D. Candidate work with [Prof. Gang Chen](http://gchenpu.com) in the [Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences](https://aos.ucla.edu) at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). I am interested in the dynamics of atmospheric circulation, with a current focus on stratosphere-troposphere coupling. In contrast to the canonical surface influence of sudden stratospheric warming (SSW), we identified a stratospheric wave precursor for cold extremes over North American in observations and comprehensive climate models.
