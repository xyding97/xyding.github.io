About
======
I am a fifth year Ph.D. Candidate working with [Prof. Gang Chen](http://gchenpu.com) in the [Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences](https://aos.ucla.edu) at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). I am broadly interested in the dynamics of atmospheric circulation, with a current focus on stratosphere-troposphere coupling. We identified a stratospheric wave precursor for surface cold extremes over North America in observations and comprehensive climate models.
