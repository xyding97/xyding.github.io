## Linkage Between Stratospheric Variability and North American Surface Air Temperature

Leveraging observations and a hierarchy of climate models, we identified a stratospheric wave precursor for cold extremes over North America. This wave precursor is distinct from SSWs in terms of its timescale, vertical structure, and surface signature. Notably, it holds greater relevance for North American cold extremes on subseasonal timescales. These findings have important implications for improving predictions of severe cold spells, which would ultimately benefit critical sectors including agriculture, transportation, energy planning, and public health.
